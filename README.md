- Smooth rendering and animations with React Three Fiber
- Lightweight and fast development environment using Vite
- TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience

## Technologies

- **React Three Fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js, enabling easy 3D graphics in React applications.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool that provides an optimal development environment.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that offers static typing for better code quality.
- **pnpm**: A fast, disk space-efficient package manager.
